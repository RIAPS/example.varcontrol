Simple control app
==================

Implements trivial algorithms for load shedding. 

The controller simply turns on/off the load, based on a duty cycle (PWM).

The various deployment models shows how the app can be deployed, possibly with multiple actors. 

The models in (1) models/loadshed (1 load) and (2) models/loadshed_2 (2 loads) can be used with this app.
